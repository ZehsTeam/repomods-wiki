# Chat Commands

Chat command can either be executed in the chat or chat and debug console depending on how you register your chat command.

### Chat

Typing a chat command in the chat requires you to start with a `/`

### Debug Console

The debug console is a new vanilla addition added in v0.3.0

::: info
You must enable `DeveloperMode` in the config settings to enable access to the debug console.
:::

::: info
Debug console commands can be executed at any time, even in the main menu and lobby menu.
:::

Typing a chat command in the debug console doesn't require you to start with a `/`

To open the debug console, press the grave key (<kbd>`</kbd>) located to the left of the <kbd>1</kbd> key, below the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key, and above the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key.

Tips:
- You can scroll up and down with the up/down arrow keys or scroll wheel. Also when an option is selected you can press tab to complete it
- You can use middle mouse click to redo the previous command you executed
- Items & valuables spawn at the closest level point whilst enemies spawn in a room nearby

## Registering Debug Commands

Registering a chat command:

```c#
using BepInEx;
using System.Collections.Generic;

[BepInPlugin("You.YourMod", "YourMod", "1.0.0")]
[BepInDependency(REPOLib.MyPluginInfo.PLUGIN_GUID)]
public class YourMod : BaseUnityPlugin
{
    private void Awake()
    {
        // Call your command's register method from your plugin's awake.
        MyCommand.Register();
    }
}

// Create a static class for your command logic.
public static class MyCommand
{
    public static void Register()
    {
        var cmd = new DebugCommandHandler.ChatCommand(
            // The name of your command.
            // This is what the user will type to execute it.
            // The name should not include spaces.
            "test",

            // The description of your command.
            "This is my test command",

            // The execute function of your command.
            Execute,

            // This argument is optional.
            // This will provide additional command argument suggestions as the user types.
            // The user must type the entire command name and a space before suggestions start showing.
            Suggest,

            // This argument is optional and true by default.
            // Function to determine if the command should be enabled.
            IsEnabled,

            // This argument is optional and true by default.
            // If true, the command will only be accessible in the debug console.
            debugOnly: false
        );

        REPOLib.Modules.Commands.RegisterCommand(cmd);
    }

    // isDebugConsole will be true if the command is being executed for the debug console.
    // args are additional options you can add to your command execution.
    private static void Execute(bool isDebugConsole, string[] args)
    {
        // You should call this function if your command executes successfully.
        DebugCommandHandler.instance?.CommandSuccessEffect();

        // You should call this function if your command execution fails.
        DebugCommandHandler.instance?.CommandFailedEffect();
    }

    // The Suggest function will only be executed if your are typing your command in the debug console.
    // You must write your command name and a space for the suggest function to start executing.
    // Every characater you add or remove will execute the Suggest function.

    // isDebugConsole will be true if the command is being executed from the debug console.
    // partial is the latest argument string from args.
    // args is the total list of arguments.
    private static List<string> Suggest(bool isDebugConsole, string partial, string[] args)
    {
        // Return a list of possible arguments based on the current partial and args.
        return [];
    }

    private static bool IsEnabled()
    {
        // Add logic here if you want to have your command be conditionally enabled.

        // Disables your command in the main menu.
        if (SemiFunc.IsSplashScreen() || SemiFunc.IsMainMenu())
        {
            return false;
        }

        // Disables your command in the lobby menu.
        if (SemiFunc.RunIsLobbyMenu())
        {
            return false;
        }

        // Disables your command in the tutorial.
        if (SemiFunc.RunIsTutorial())
        {
            return false;
        }

        // Disables your command if you are not the host.
        if (!SemiFunc.IsMasterClientOrSingleplayer())
        {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
